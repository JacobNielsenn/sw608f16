Indoor positioning systems (IPS) locate objects inside a restricted area, this is typically done via mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. This is done by using multiple access-points each calculating the distance to the device and with a combined effort positioning the device with high accuracy\cite{WhatIsIPS}.

In his blog \textit{The Next Big Thing}, Don Dodge states that he believe indoor positioning and location will be one of the five technologies in which there will be the most progress over the next five years\cite{DonDIndoorIsNext}.

People spend 87\% of their time in indoor paces and with buildings becoming more complex e.g. airports, malls and university campuses, there is an increased need for indoor location systems.
