\section{Gitlab}
From the aSTEP meeting that toke place 17.02.2016 it was decided that a few people across the groups should take responsibility for maintaining the gitlab server. Two members of our group volunteered for this task. The section purpose is to describe the work that our group has done related to gitlab.

We toke on the task of updating the gitlab that was running on our aSTEP virtual server, the magnitude of this task involves installing a virtual server on one of our groups computer to emulate the gitlab update to ensure that if it fails to update, we will not endanger the aSTEPs gitlab.
