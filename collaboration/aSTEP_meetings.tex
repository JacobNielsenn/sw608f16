\section{aSTEP meetings}
In the aSTEP project ten groups are working together to make one large system with multiple applications. To keep track of all groups progress and their needs i regard to other parts of the system, being developed by other groups, there are being held weekly meetings with one representative from each group. In addition to this there are being held smaller meetings, where only a few groups participate, in order to specify needs and possible ideas.

At the large meetings our representative have been responsible for taking notes after which he writes a summary and makes it available for everyone.

We have had multiple smaller meetings with respectively the groups responsible for the database, the application group utilizing indoor positioning and the user management group. At meetings with the application group they have specified what data they need and we have explained how we can provide it. At meetings with the database groups there have been talked about what data we want to be stored based on what we have been told by the application group and they have specified how they would like to receive the data.
