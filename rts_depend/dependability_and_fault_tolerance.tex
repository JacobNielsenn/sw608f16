\chapter{Dependability and Fault Tolerance}\label{ch:rts_depend}
This chapter introduces the concept of dependability and the concept of a dependable system as defined in \textcite{rts_depend}.\\
The system is then analysed in the context of this concept of dependability for the purpose of improving the system. 

The paper discusses the definition of dependability and provides the following two definitions:
\begin{quote}
  The original definition of dependability is the ability to
  deliver service that can justifiably be trusted. This definition
  stresses the need for justification of trust. The alternate
  definition that provides the criterion for deciding if the
  service is dependable is \textbf{the dependability of a system is the
  ability to avoid service failures that are more frequent and
  more severe than is acceptable}.
\end{quote}
  
The alternate definition is useful as it provides a way of reasoning about the degree of provisions which should be made to ensure sufficient dependability.

\textcite{rts_depend} further provides the following subdivision and relationship to describe dependability and security.

    \label{fig:sub_depend}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure} 

As shown in \cref{fig:rel_depend} there is a great deal of overlap between dependability and security. 
Security introduces the concept of confidentiality, however security is not a part of dependability as a system may need to be dependable without the need for security.
Due to the overlap, the combined attributes will hereafter simply be referred to as "attributes of dependability".
