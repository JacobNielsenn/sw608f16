\section{Permission} \label{sec:permission}
By using Cisco it is possible to acquire and store peoples unique Mac-address and use this to track them. It is illegal to do so without the individuals acceptance, it is as such necessary to accommodate this regulation when designing the system \cite{TrafficIlligal}.
There have been several trials in Denmark as a consequence of this regulation. A Traffic system has recorded passerbys by registering the WI-FI signal emitted from smart phones. This is done by sensors registering the unique Mac-address, which were hashed and re-hashed in the sensors before being stored. Despite that it does not make it possible to track the users\cite{TrafficIlligal}, it is illegal according to the \textit{Directive on privacy and electronic communications} article 5(3)\cite{CookieDirective} which can be seen in the following quote,

\begin{quote}
\textit{'Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information...'}
\end{quote}

However, the Danish Business Authoritys conclusion to this was that the system did not fit in \textit{Directive on privacy and electronic communications} due to the end-user being unidentifiable\cite{TrafficOK} as described by article 3(1)\cite{CookieDirective}.

To ensure no such debates being raised in relation to this project, it will be necessary to differ between those who have given their permission to this and those who have not. By differing between these it will be possible to sort out any identifiers form those who have not agreed to their unique information being stored.
