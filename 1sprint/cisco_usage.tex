\section{Using Cisco on AAU}
%husk at forklare om CPI og MSE
The Cisco localisation and positioning system is already in use on Aalborg University. To be able to use the information from the system, we had a meeting with the administrator, Per Mejdal Rasmussen \sfx{ask him if we're allowed to mention him}, during which concerns for privacy was raised, as well as a desire of being able to provide this data to future student projects. To accommodate this, it has been asked of us to build and deploy an intermediate service with the goal of obfuscating sensitive personal data, such as mac-addresses and user name. This service is intended to duplicate the functionality of the Cisco Restful API, such that the service acts as a transparent proxy. This is achieved by creating an intermediate Restful service, that simply redirects requests and processes the response before redirecting it back to the initial requester, as illustrated on \cref{fig:cisco_usage}.

\begin{figure}[h]

A Restful service typically communicates using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols, and functions by receiving requests on specific URIs to which it responds in a predefined way. As an example we can send a HTTPS GET request to 64.103.26.61 with the URI "/api/contextaware/v1/location/clients" and, given that we supply the correct user name and password, receive a string of data corresponding to the type of request. \sfx{kilde}

To create a transparent Restful service that duplicates the functionality of the Cisco Restful API, we need to make use of the same URIs as the Cisco API\sfx{link to cisco api}. This is done with the use of the Jersey Java library, which affords the possibility of creating a HTTP server and specifying what URIs can be requested.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Adding a URI},label={lst:context_code},language=inc_Java]
server.createContext("/api/contextaware/v1/location/clients", httpExchange -> {
            if (VerifyConnection(httpExchange) == false){
                return;
            }

            String response = CollectAllClients(username, password, ciscoIp);
            httpExchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
            OutputStream os = httpExchange.getResponseBody();
            os.write(response.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF-8")));
            os.close();
        });
\end{lstlisting}
The code example shown on \cref{lst:context_code} shows how this is done. The createContext method takes two parameters: a string for the URI and an anonymous function implementing an interface. The anonymous function decides what actions are performed once a connection is established, in this case some verification is performed immediately to authenticate the user. A response is generated based on the URI; on line 4 we retrieve all clients from Cisco, which is then written though an OutputStream to the requester. 

In order to accommodate the privacy concern, we implement some simple methods to obfuscate mac-address and user name.
