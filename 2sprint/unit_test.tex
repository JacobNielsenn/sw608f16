\section{Unit Testing}
To supply the next year student, that will continue this project, with a better understating of our code and what the essence of it is, all methods have been tested and documented. 
The test are also necessary since there is 9 other groups that is depending our code to be working.

\subsection{Testing Purpose}
%Next year student
The code that have been developed in this project will be further improved and expanded by the next year students in order to better support the needs of the platform. 
By writing tests to all of the code, these developers a better start when they get their hands on the project. 
This report will help them understand why some design decisions have been made and what the purpose of the system is as a whole, but what the individual methods are supposed to do will not be covered in its entirety. 
By testing the methods with tests that checks if an given input returns an expected result, will help the developers to get a clearer understanding of what the methods are supposed to do. 
This understanding are further enhanced by the documentation that also describes the methods as explained in Section \ref{sec:code_documentation} \nameref{sec:code_documentation}. 

%Debugging intern and extern
This project involves the collaboration between 10 groups to develop the aStep platform. 
Many of the aStep components communicates with each other by calling methods or sharing data.
Tests are therefore beneficial as they can be used in debugging situations when big changes are made to the aStep system. 
Sometimes a change in
