\section{Code Documentation} \label{sec:code_documentation}
Due to collaboration with other groups and to make the code easy to read for future semesters, there have been put in a extra effort to documentation of the code. The documentation thereof have been done by commenting all non-trivial methods in the program, there have been commented on the general function of the method, each parameter, what it returns and on the exception thrown by some of the methods, in addition there are links between some methods calling classes or other methods. When the commenting is complete we generate a Java-Doc and upload it to GitLab, for other members of the project to see. By having used links in the comments this grants us links in the generated Java-doc to get a more interactive documentation. 
\ofx{Should this be moved to collaboration or is it fine here?}
