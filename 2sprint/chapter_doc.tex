\chapter{Sprint 2}
In this chapter we describe the work done in the second sprint. Since it have been chosen to utilize Cisco, which is available to us at Aalborg University, the main goal for this sprint is to make the connection and send data from Cisco to the aStep database, as can be seen in \cref{fig:cisco_systems}. There will also be focused on unit testing the code and taken time to describe our collaboration with the other groups assigned to the aStep project.
