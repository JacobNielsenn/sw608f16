\chapter{Sprint 2}
In this chapter we describe the work done in the second sprint. Since it have been chosen to utilize Cisco, which is available to us at Aalborg University, the main goal for this sprint is to make the connection and send data from Cisco to the aStep database, as it can be seen in \cref{fig:cisco_systems}. There will also be focused on unit testing the code, looked into possibilities to find geographical locations rather than the relative position supplied by Cisco as of now. Finally there will be taken time to describe our collaboration with the other groups assigned to the aStep project.
