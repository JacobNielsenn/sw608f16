\chapter{Future Work}
\label{Cha:Future_Work}
In this chapter we describe what we believe will be advantageously for future students to look into in order to improve and further the system 
%This chapter list the aspect of Cisco system and Indoor location based service work, for future semesters.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Research better ways of obfuscating the MAC addresses so it is not stored in plain text.\ofx{have we not done this sufficient now?}
	\item Secure the connection between Cisco system and the DB server, so data is not possible to sniff.
\end{itemize}


\section{Data Flow from Cisco to the Database}\label{sec:data_flow}

\Cref{fig:cisco_systems} shows how the information flow is intended. The client connecting to the Cisco services can function as a server that requests data from all Cisco services that we have access to. Alternatively, a server can be implemented for each Cisco service. However, this solution has several downsides. First, it means corporations supplying the aSTEP project with information will have to have hardware running the server, which requires maintenance. Second, this solution is not scalable. The server running the aSTEP database will potentially be overloaded, as it has to handle each individual Cisco system sending information. As more Cisco systems are added, there will be less time to process received data. An alternative approach is to have the aSTEP database server request data from the mobile apps, however, with an increase in connected Cisco systems, the interval at which we receive new information from a given system also increases. The optimal solution to this issue is to create a hierarchy of servers, such that the database server only receives data from a constant amount of intermediate servers, each of which also receive information from an amount of sources. During the start up of the aSTEP project we have access to a single Cisco MSE system, and as such we will not focus on building this hierarchy. However, as the project grows and additional Cisco systems are integrated, it will eventually become a necessity.

\section{Further development on intermediate server}\label{sec:future_intermediate}
As we are working on developing these tools to gather data, Cisco are further developing MSE. It is likely that new functionality has been added once development continues on this project, and it is therefore suggested that MSE is updated. The documentation for the newest version can always be found online, including the RESTful api documentation. From what we experienced, the documentation for the RESTful api is very poor, and requires additional effort to test functionality and acquire a good understanding of the api. Newer versions of MSE have some features that initially appear useful, but require a closer look to determine whether the project can make use it. We have chosen not to put effort into examining these features, as the documentation is very poor and easily misunderstood, and we have had very limited access to a system where we could test functionality.

One slightly obscure feature that MSE offers is to obfuscate MAC addresses. We do not know whether this is a binary setting, or if it is possible to configure this in more advanced ways. Similarly, MSE also offer the ability to subscribe to movement, such that subscribers are notified when movement occurs. However, this requires additional configuration on the MSE side, as well as a server that MSE can notify. Lastly, we suspect it might be possible to simply request positioning for the devices that have changed positions recently. We suggest these features are further explored.
