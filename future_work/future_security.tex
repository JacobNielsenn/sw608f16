\section{Security}\label{sec:fucture_secure}
More features could be implemented to further security in our system, as discussed in \cref{sec:secure}. We believe this is something for future students to focus on and to implement, as we work with sensitive information which should be handled sufficiently.

\subsection*{HTTPS on the Intermediate Server}
We believe the most significant improvement future students can make to further security in this system would be to implement HTTPS on the intermediate server.

Using \emph{lets encrypt}, HTTPS can be enabled. This was done on the aSTEP server, so we contacted one of the persons responsible for doing so. He told us it took approximately 3 weeks and the reason why it took so long was because they were unable to open a port and set up a domain which is required for lets encrypt. 
Based on this information we estimated that we would be unable to implement HTTPS within the time limit.

\subsection*{Certificate}
The intermediate server does not use the certificate to verify that the data is coming from the MSE server running at Cassiopeia. This is categorised as a security risk and should be fixed in future development.
