\chapter{Sprint 4}
This is the last sprint and will be dedicated to implementing some final features discovered in sprint 3 and improving the overall code quality. This includes implementing some of the functionality discussed in \cref{sec:secure} as well as preparing the code for handing over to the new developers. Additionally, a section will be prepared for future developers to ease the transition and make it easier to get up to speed.

\section{Sprint Evaluation}
To perform an evaluation of the sprint we iterate over the sprint goals and comment on whether or not they were fulfilled.

We set out to update both the intermediate server and the client server following the security considerations made in \cref{sec:secure}. These updates successfully implemented several features as well as refactored code to streamline the code style.

Finally, we planned on preparing a section dedicated to ease the transitioning for future developers. \Cref{sec:catchup} contains information on how to perform different tasks and solve problems that are essential for the project.
