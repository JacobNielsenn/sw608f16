\chapter{Hardware Selection}
\label{chp:tech}
In this chapter a description of both the hardware and software components utilised in the system setup will be presented. These components are designed and developed by external suppliers, and the description will contain the argumentation for why it has been chosen to utilise a given component.

The descriptions include how hardware is used for the laser unit and camera units, how these units interact and how the final system setup is structured as a result of the choices.
