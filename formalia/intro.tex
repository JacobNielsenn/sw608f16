\chapter{Introduction}\label{chpt:introduction}
Surveillance is becoming an increasingly more important aspect in present day. In an attempt to increase the safety of its citizens, governments all over the world install public cameras\cite{city_surveillance}. At the same time the dream of intelligent robots with human-like behaviour, as depicted in movies such as "I, Robot"\cite{imdb_robot}, is nearing. Development of artificial intelligence is a hot topic in 2015, and several experts predict that  soon will be an integral element of everyday life\cite{ai_microsoft}.

An important element of programming machines to exercise human-like behaviour is the ability to sense and interact with their environment. Giving a machine senses is one thing, but teaching the machine how to react on these sensing inputs is an extremely complex task\cite{facebook_ai}. A problem as simple as using a camera to simulate vision and then finding and recognising a complex object, such as the face of a person, is a computationally heavy task\cite{ai_facial_recog}.

%Recognition can also be used in a militaristic context. A system could be able to recognise objects, say an enemy vehicle, and follow this vehicle's movement, waiting for permission to fire\cite{rockwell_system}. Soldiers in the field could then carry a device that they could quickly be set up and use for monitoring an area, perhaps even with several cameras to have a greater  to monitor. Another system could be set up to monitor and protect embassies in foreign countries by tracking and shooting unrecognised intruders.

Recognition is also used for security systems in buildings with valuable possessions. Such a location could be a museum with irreplaceable objects like paintings and other artefacts, which need to be kept safe from intruders. The challenges this system could face are tasks such as monitoring a 3D space, identifying and distinguishing valuable artefacts from objects of no interest and continue tracking them in motion.

This project aims to build a simplified version of the museum security system and explores the theme of surveillance, in connection with embedded devices, with the primary focus of creating a targeting platform that is able to recognise a predefined object. The system will incorporate a secondary focus of tracking the object with the intention of notifying some second system to ensure the safety of the predefined object.
