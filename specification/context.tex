\section{Problem and Context}\label{sec:prob_cont}


Part of the base problem is that cameras capture 2D images and with the use of several cameras it is possible to calculate an object's movement in 3D space more precisely. 

The setup for such a security system consists of multiple cameras to supervise each room from different angles. 


In order to accommodate this context and the needs associated with it, the museum scenario is used in further aspects and specifications. The first aspect is defining the set of requirements that gives a sufficient solution for the context.
