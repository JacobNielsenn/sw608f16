\chapter{Work areas}
%Content of chapter is a describtion of different aspects which needs to be defined before a position
In order to identify an object using two or more cameras and thereby track it by a laser require definitions and tests of hardware and software. Section \ref{sec:prob_cont} gives a context and section \ref{sec:base_setup} gives a base setup for which these definitions are build upon. This chapter presents a descriptions of six different areas that needs to be defined if the problem given by the context shall be solved. 

The six areas includes can be separated into two main topics, \emph{Mathematical Models and Software Development} and \emph{Technology Choices and Tests}. All areas that relates to mathematical models or software development are part of the topic. The rest of the areas are part of the second topic which includes choosing technologies and the relevant tests of these. This chapter there are no results or choices are presented but the reason for the area are presented. The different areas are then in depth presented throughout the report in later chapters.

The two topics have the following areas:
\begin{itemize}
		\item Technology Choices and Tests
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Hardware Selection and Tests
			\item Rig Design
			\item Fixed starting position for laser pointer
		\end{itemize}
	  \item Mathematical Models and Theories
	  \begin{itemize}
	  	\item Object recognition
	  	\item Position calculation
	  	\item Algorithm for controlling motors
	  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
