\chapter{Mathematical Models and Theories}
In order to calculate the position of an object in a 3D space, from the use of 2D images from viewpoints, a number of steps are executed. Firstly it is necessary to calculate the angles from each viewpoint's centre to the object's position. The angle information from two or more viewpoints can then be combined to calculate the object's position in the global coordinate system defined in \cref{sec:coor} which makes the laser unit able to target it. The chapter presents how a pixel found in a image can be used to calculate the direction towards to target relatively from the given camera.

This chapter also presents the model for a \acrlong{pid} and how it is used when using DC motors.
