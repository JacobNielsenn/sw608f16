\chapter{Object Recognition Approach}\label{ch:obj_rec}
To recognise an object in an image, different methods of object recognition can be used. In this chapter three methods are presented: edge, shape and colour recognition. Where edge and shape covers different methods used for actual recognition, colour recognition introduces aspects that must be considered if the recognition is done on colour images.

A universal trait for edge and shape recognition is that there are many different implementations for each of them. The following section, "\nameref{sc:com_vision}" in \ref{sc:com_vision}, describes the common issues with image analysis. Following this, the general concepts of egde and shape are described and the aspects of colour is introduced.  After the introduction of edge, shape and colour recognition, it is decided in \cref{sc:obj_final} which methods to use and how to perform the actual recognition. The chapter is based on the book "Image Processing Analysis, and Machine Vision" \cite{obj_recogn_book} and supported by the article "Shape recognition with edge-based features" \cite{shape_recogn}.
