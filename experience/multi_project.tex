\section{Working in a Multi-Project}
We are encountered with a set of different challenges when working in a multi-project compared to the traditional format, which we are used to. In order to cope with the new setting, our group has had to change work ethics in regards to other groups and the use of group-rooms.

\subsection*{Organisation}
It is necessary to enforce an organisational structure to efficiently establish an overview of the multi-project when collaborating with a large group of people. As described in \cref{subsec:supergroup_meetings}, we needed to know how far the different groups were with their separate parts of the multi-project and what kind of problems they were facing. If one group could not make any serious progress because of some hindrance, it was important that the other groups were notified, in case they were depending on their work. We uncovered the vast majority of these problems by organising what resembles a Scrum stand up meeting, at the super-group meetings where every representative reported their individual project status. If a group had a problem they were unable to solve themselves, they could draw help from the other groups, or move some of their tasks to them. It should be noted that it was only multi-project wide tasks that could be transferred, such as updating the GitLab server or implementing a logging system.

The super-group meetings were accompanied by smaller multi-project wide meetings where a single specific topic would be discussed. For instance, a topic we discussed was regarding the type of license that would be applied to the multi-project.

A set of tools were used in order to ensure efficient communication acrss the multi-prject. In addition to the aforementioned meetings, the individual groups would occasionally arrange private meetings, as described in \cref{subsec:small_meetings}. These kind of meetings would usually involve two groups with some representatives from both parties. In order to avoid disturbing other groups when planning an meeting, the appointment would be discussed by using the message web application Slack \cite{slack}. It was encouraged to be discrete when contacting other groups as multiple groups share the same group-rooms, and external disturbances had to be kept to a minimum. This was also the leading factor for why many of these meetings took place outside of the group-rooms.

\subsubsection*{What Could Be Better}
There was still room for improvement, both project-wise and group-wise, as instances of miscommunication, distrust to others groups' work and lack of access to general information all occurred over the course of the multi-project.

We faced a problem internally in the group which sprung out from how we handled the information we got from the super-group meetings. We would usually send the same representative who had two major responsibilities: verifying that we had prepared what was asked from us to the next meeting and conveying the key points from the last meeting to the group. It would be better if the representative was chosen anew each time in order to avoid that it was only one from the group who had a good overview of the multi-project. Another solution could be to arrange a short intern meeting in the group after each super-group meeting in order to check that everyone is up to date. It would have been beneficial to solve this issue as the consequence was that we occasionally forgot to complete certain tasks before their deadlines or went against some of the decisions that had been made. It would be beneficial for the  multi-project teamwork and the individual group member's sense of involvement in it.

A weekly topic that recurred on super-group meetings was the status update from each group. It was problematic that some groups did not take this presentation seriously and would not mention the problems they were facing, or left out details that could have been useful for the other groups. It also meant that other groups perceived them as being slow and unresponsive to their requests, even if it was them unfit and they actually did what they could in order to keep up. Groups would delay some of their tasks because they thought that other groups would rapidly finish the part they were depending on, even though it in some cases took entire weeks before the part were complete. This was frustrating for those whom depended on the completion of the tasks. It meant that they sometimes would need to redesign parts of their solution, or worse, cancel further work as they would not have time to finish.

It would be better if all groups put proper effort into the status presentation such that issues could be resolved earlier or entirely avoided.

\subsection*{Working Environment}
When working with multiple teams, it becomes apparent that mutual respect between the groups are important to uphold a healthy working environment.

One method to uphold this environment have already been mentioned, being discrete and non-disturbing when planning and attending private group meetings, but there are other areas which can have a positive influence. 

In addition to planning meetings, Slack was also used as the main communication outlet between the groups. Multiple channels, or rooms, were created and dedicated to different topics such as "Indoor", "DataBase", "Meeting", "Gitlab Administration Support" etc. It was elected at a super-group meeting that everyone are required to be available on Slack in the work hours during weekdays. This allowed groups, who preferred not to use crowded group-rooms, to work from other locations and still be reachable. Additionally, it was warranted that the student mail address list should not be used, such that the primary communication only took place in one forum.  

In order to keep the group-rooms quiet, it was discouraged to arrange supervisor-meetings in the group-rooms. This meant that the groups would often move the meeting to their supervisors office or lend a room at campus. This was another attempt to make the group-rooms pleasant to work in.

Experience from the last semester, the fifth, encouraged us to make rules for how to access and use the shared refrigerator. We had a problem with spoiled food as people would leave their lunch and forget about it. Another issue lied in people walking in and out of the group room where the fridge was placed, which was disturbing. Because of these reasons, an agreement on visiting hours and when it was allowed to throw away leftover food was established. This agreement resulted in a decrease in disturbances and was an overall improvement to the working environment. 

\subsection*{Overall Opinion}
A set of solutions were used to combat the new challenges that we faced this semester, in order to uphold a healthy working environment and to ensure that a large group could work together in warm fellowship.

We assess that the overall cooperation between the groups have been satisfactory, as the issues were resolved with a common compliance. The problems were not too major to inflict notable damage to the multi-project. This is due to the overall effort from all the groups to make the best of this multi-project.
